## About the Materials

What is here is quickly assembled. I am heavily borrowing from course materials by Amelia McNamara for a 2-day course that she gave at rstudio::conf 2018. Her repo is here: [https://github.com/AmeliaMN/IntroToR] 
I am also using material from "R for Data Science" as a guide -- the full book is available as a website here: [http://r4ds.had.co.nz/]

First session:
 - Get familiar with the RStudio environment
 - How to run scripts, install packages, and find documentation
 - Read in and play around with an example dataset

Subsequent sessions:
 - Loading data from csv/xlsx
 - Basic data manipulation (e.g., filter, join, add new variables)
 - Plotting
 - We'll see...
